!cht go reverse a list
!cht python random list elements
!cht js parse json

# To display help (this page):
!cht --help

# So what had been bothering me before was caused by the differences between Discord's programming language index (taken from highlight.js)
# and cheat.sh's. For example discord dosen't recognize python3.
# I can't see an immediate solution, so I think the best way around this is a dict of aliases.
# We can add a new alias whenever we find out about it.
